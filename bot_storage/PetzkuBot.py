"""First bot. Made for Dentosal's chess bot competition.

Rules:
1. Program recieves two lines of input.
1.1 The first line consists of the Forsythâ€“Edwards Notation
	representation of the game
1.2 The second line has all the possible moves in the situation
	in Standard Algebraic Notation, separated by spaces.
2. Program shall output the move it makes in the situation and exit.
2.1 Program must always make the same move in a given situation.
2.2 If the program doesn't give its move within 1 second,
	a move will be decided for it.

Description:
Prioritizes checkmates, then any captures, then any promotions,
finally any checks. Captures also prioritize promotions and checks,
and promotions prioritize checks.
If nothing else is available, program picks third available move.
This loops around if necessary.
Never underpromotes unless check or mate is available.
